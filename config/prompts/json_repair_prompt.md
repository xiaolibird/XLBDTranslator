You previously provided a JSON response that was syntactically incorrect, resulting in the following error:

<error_details>
{error_details}
</error_details>

The original prompt given to you was:
<original_prompt>
{original_prompt}
</original_prompt>

And your faulty JSON output was:
<broken_json>
{broken_json}
</broken_json>

Your task is to **CORRECT the JSON syntax only**, based on the original prompt's requirements and the provided broken JSON.
Return ONLY the corrected, valid JSON object. Do not add any conversational text or explanation.
